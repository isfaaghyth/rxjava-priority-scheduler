While thinking about the intersection of [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [Android](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid), I realized there was no default scheduler in the library that allowed for prioritizing actions before others, similar to how [Volley](http://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html)'s [Request.Priority](https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley/blob/bea90385b1b847553a86425347fc3f560db98581/src/com/android/volley/Request.java#L503). I decided to try and work something together and this is what I initially came up with. Some of the threading seems a bit strange and the [Worker](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/7dbed13ccc68bba80816311fe7c27126fe6d6d8f/src/main/java/rx/Scheduler.java#L60) works (no pun intended) a bit differently than others, but it seems to do the trick. Gladly accepting comments/pull requests!

Submitting to Maven Central soon!
